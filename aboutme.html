		<h2>Interests and hobbies:</h2>
		
		<p>Above all, I'm a curious person.  My desire to learn and understand the world around me has lead me into many areas beyond my construction focused careeer:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Amateur radio - FCC General class license since 2015 with callsign W0DVO. The peculiarities of RF make for an interesting puzzle.</li>
			<li>Welding and fabrication.  Have been fascinated with welding since I was a kid, and made a living with it for a while.</li>
			<li>Programming. I know enough to know I don't know much. Played with Python a bit, JS a tiny bit.</li>
			<li>Woodworking, mostly in a meta sense. I enjoy making things that make my workshop nicer to use.</li>
			<li>Anything tech related. I'm typically an early adopter. I've owned <i>$lastname</i>.com for 13 years now and use it for my (grandfathered-in and still free) Google Workspace account though which I provide email and Google's other services to my family.</li>
			<li>Blacksmithing.</li>
			<li>Electronics.</li>
			<li>Metrology.</li>
